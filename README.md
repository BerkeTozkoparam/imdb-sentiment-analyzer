# IMDb Sentiment Analyzer

This project analyzes movie reviews and predicts whether the sentiment is **positive** or **negative**. The model is built using Keras and the user interface is implemented with Gradio for an easy-to-use web application.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for entering movie reviews.
- Predicts whether the review is **positive** or **negative**.
- Displays the probability score of the prediction.
- Shareable interface using Gradio.

## This movie was an absolute disaster. Terrible acting, a nonsensical plot, and completely wasted my time. I regret watching it
